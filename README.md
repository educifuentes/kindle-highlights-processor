### üîß Install as a Global Command (macOS/Linux)

You can make this script globally accessible from the terminal by installing it as a command-line tool:

1. **Ensure the script starts with a shebang line** at the top of `process_kindle.py`:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```

2. **Make the script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x process_kindle.py
    ```

3. **Move it to a directory in your system PATH** (you‚Äôll need admin permissions):

    ```bash
    sudo mv process_kindle.py /usr/local/bin/kindle-notes
    ```

4. **Run it from anywhere:**

    ```bash
    kindle-notes path/to/your_notebook.html
    ```

    The Markdown file will be saved in your current working directory as `<notebook>_notes.md`.

5. **To uninstall later:**

    ```bash
    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/kindle-notes
    ```
