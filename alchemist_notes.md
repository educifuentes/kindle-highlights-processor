  - 
    “And you’ve told me nothing along the way,” said the boy. “I thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know. A while ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy. But I wasn’t able to learn anything from them.”

  - 
    “Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the desert, that there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race.

  - 
    “Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy said. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see.”

  - 
    “Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your treasure.” “But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I’m thinking about her.” “Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say.”

  - 
    “Before this, I always looked to the desert with longing,” said Fatima. “Now it will be with hope.

  - 
    “But don’t worry,” the alchemist continued. “Usually the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives.”

  - 
    “Don’t give in to your fears,” said the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice. “If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.”

  - 
    “Don’t say anything,” Fatima interrupted. “One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.” But the boy continued, “I had a dream, and I met with a king. I sold crystal and crossed the desert. And, because the tribes declared war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”

  - 
    “Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy told his heart.

  - 
    “For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”

  - 
    “From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are only three hours from the Pyramids.” “Thank you,” said the boy. “You taught me the Language of the World.” “I only invoked what you already knew.”

  - 
    “I always knew,” he says, “that my Personal Legend, to use a term from alchemy, was to write.” He was thirty-eight when he published his first book.

  - 
    “I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist said. “I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found Fatima, and, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than treasure.”

  - 
    “I’m going with you,” the boy said. And he immediately felt peace in his heart.

  - 
    “I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel drivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent.”

  - 
    “If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”

  - 
    “If we’re going to go our separate ways soon,” the boy said, “then teach me about alchemy.” “You already know about alchemy. It is about penetrating to the Soul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been reserved for you.”

  - 
    “It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world say,” continued the old man. “It describes people’s inability to choose their own Personal Legends. And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world’s greatest lie.”

  - 
    “It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.”

  - 
    “It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.”

  - 
    “Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.”

  - 
    “Maktub,” the merchant said, finally. “What does that mean?” “You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he answered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is written.’”

  - 
    “Men have never understood the words of the wise. So gold, instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for conflict.”

  - 
    “My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”

  - 
    “No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way.

  - 
    “No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure.”

  - 
    “People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,” said the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they give up on it so early, too. But that’s the way it is.”

  - 
    “Somewhere you are holding the person I love,” the boy said. “So, when I look out over your sands, I am also looking at her. I want to return to her, and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the wind.”

  - 
    “That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.” “Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?” “Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about the world.”

  - 
    “That’s not true,” the boy said. “I learned the alchemist’s secrets in my travels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the stars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made by the same hand, and we have the same soul.

  - 
    “That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.”

  - 
    “The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can afford to travel,” his father said. “Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds.” “Well, then I’ll be a shepherd!”

  - 
    “There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey. You need to learn only one thing more.”

  - 
    “They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. “They were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.”

  - 
    “This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will search for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he was in his former life.

  - 
    “To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist answered. “When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.”

  - 
    “We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.”

  - 
    “Well, it’s a long list. But the path was written in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to himself.

  - 
    “Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy. “Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive.

  - 
    “What good is money to you if you’re going to die? It’s not often that money can save someone’s life,” the alchemist had said.

  - 
    “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?” “I am following my Personal Legend. It’s not something you would understand.”

  - 
    “What is an alchemist?” he asked, finally. “It’s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted to, he could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind.”

  - 
    “When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the alchemist, echoing the words of the old king. The boy understood. Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.

  - 
    “When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it,” the old king had said.

  - 
    “Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the alchemist had told him.

  - 
    “You didn’t have to do any cleaning,” he said. “The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person.”

  - 
    “You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re different from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just want to dream about Mecca.

  - 
    “You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had said. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.

  - 
    “You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it wasn’t true love . . . the love that speaks the Language of the World.”

  - 
    And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you are in love, things make even more sense, he thought.

  - 
    At that point, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever. “Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon you, because you’ve stopped listening to them.

  - 
    But I’m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”

  - 
    But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man’s sins.

  - 
    But the boy was already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming.

  - 
    But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop.

  - 
    But you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The desert will give you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything on the face of the earth will do that.

  - 
    But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”

  - 
    But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little to one another.

  - 
    Curse the moment I met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd.

  - 
    Everything depended on one word: “Maktub.”

  - 
    From that day on, the oasis would be an empty place for her.

  - 
    From then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please, never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far from his dreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy swore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its message.

  - 
    He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.

  - 
    He recalled that when the sun had risen that morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through the familiar fields.

  - 
    He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.

  - 
    He remembered something his grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen. Like crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and four-leaf clovers.

  - 
    He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn’t even have yet.

  - 
    He said to the boy, “Show me where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure.”

  - 
    He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.

  - 
    He thought of all the married shepherds he had known. They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love required them to stay with the people they loved.

  - 
    He thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she had probably married. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd who could read and could tell her exciting stories—after all, he probably wasn’t the only one.

  - 
    He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he had never perceived before.

  - 
    His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were: his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his Personal Legend, and his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.

  - 
    I didn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel worse than I did before you arrived.

  - 
    I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go on living.

  - 
    It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired.

  - 
    It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace.

  - 
    It’s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal Legend, the boy thought.

  - 
    Just as you know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.” “Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled. “Maktub,” said the old crystal merchant. And he gave the boy his blessing.

  - 
    Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy.

  - 
    Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust that man. “I’m like everyone else—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.”

  - 
    Now, I can see that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t know how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am.”

  - 
    On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a friend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I don’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and all the time I need. Why not?

  - 
    On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their Personal Legend.

  - 
    Once again, he perceived the many languages in the things about him: this time, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous.

  - 
    Paulo Coelho once said that following your dream is like learning a foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in the end.

  - 
    People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve them.

  - 
    People continue to ask me if I knew The Alchemist would be such a huge success. The answer is no. I had no idea. How could I? When I sat down to write The Alchemist, all I knew is that I wanted to write about my soul. I wanted to write about my quest to find my treasure.

  - 
    People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don’t know what they’re saying.

  - 
    So now I’m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.

  - 
    Take to the fields, and someday you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women are the most beautiful.”

  - 
    Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that woman, and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew she existed. He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world.

  - 
    That’s why I’m here in the middle of the desert. I’m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes.”

  - 
    The alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn’t know it.”

  - 
    The alchemist sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never forget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one another, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.”

  - 
    The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other.

  - 
    The boy could see in his father’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a desire that was still alive,

  - 
    The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.

  - 
    The boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of.

  - 
    The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had given the general. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk.

  - 
    The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it’s all written there.

  - 
    The boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said. “Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the alchemist.

  - 
    The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region.

  - 
    The old man continued, “In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.”

  - 
    The story of one person is the story of everyone, and one man’s quest is the quest of all of humanity,

  - 
    The wind was listening closely, and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom had its limitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World.

  - 
    There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is important to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and, when that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others—because Allah is on both sides.”

  - 
    There must be a language that doesn’t depend on words, the boy thought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now it’s happening with people.

  - 
    There’s one that says, ‘Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their horses.

  - 
    They seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back, his heart bursting with joy. Because now he knew where his treasure was.

  - 
    They trust me, and they’ve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.

  - 
    Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule.

  - 
    To continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.

  - 
    When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”

  - 
    When I read about clashes around the world—political clashes, economic clashes, cultural clashes—I am reminded that it is within our power to build a bridge to be crossed. Even if my neighbor doesn’t understand my religion or understand my politics, he can understand my story. If he can understand my story, then he’s never too far from me.

  - 
    When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.”

  - 
    When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.

  - 
    Who knows . . . maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself.

  - 
    Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning. Maktub, thought the boy.

    You’ll spend the rest of your days knowing that you didn’t pursue your Personal Legend, and that now it’s too late.

  - 
    and he didn’t want to think about the possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.

  - 
    and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world.

  - 
    because they don’t follow their hearts.” “Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams?” the boy asked the alchemist. “Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t like to suffer.”

  - 
    could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.” “What a lovely story,” the alchemist thought.

  - 
    couldn’t have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.

  - 
    had already imagined the scene many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front. He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most

  - 
    he achieved a self-awareness and a spiritual awakening that he later described in The Pilgrimage.

  - 
    he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.

  - 
    looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a strange place; it was a new one.

  - 
    spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over the desert, and listening to his heart. The boy knew the desert sensed his fear. They both spoke the same language.

  - 
    the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full of surprises, and they had to be aware of many things:

  - 
    the omens told him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.

  - 
    the other foreigner, the Englishman. He’s the one that’s looking for you.” “He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He has begun to try to understand the desert.” “And what about me?”

  - 
    was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with its endless monotony, put him to dreaming.
